\item {\it Given  Ar at P$_{1}$ = 140 kPa, T$_{1}$ = 10$^{o}$C, V$_{1}$ = 200 liters which undergoes a polytropic compression to P$_{2}$ = 700 kPa, T$_{2}$ = 180 $^{o}$C, find Q$_{1}^{2}$.}


In order to calculate Q$_{1}^{2}$, we will need to invoke the first law,
\begin{displaymath}
U_{2} - U_{1} = Q_{1}^{2} - W_{1}^{2} 
\end{displaymath}
For ideal gases, we need to calculate $\Delta U$ (based on $\Delta T$) and we can easily compute $W_{1}^{2}$ from its definition as $\int\limits_{1}^{2}PdV$. Using the following data for noble gas {\it Ar}:
\begin{displaymath}
MW\footnote{MW: Molecular weight; R: Universal gas constant; C$_{v}$: Heat capacity at constant volume.}=39.948 kg.\left(kmole\right)^{-1}\;\;\;\; R=0.2081 kJ.\left(kg.K\right)^{-1}\;\;\;\;C_{v}=0.312 kJ.\left(kg.K\right)^{-1}
\end{displaymath}
The mass of {\it Ar} can be calculated from state 1:
\begin{displaymath}
m=\displaystyle\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{RT_{1}}=\displaystyle\frac{ \left(140 kPa\right) \left(0.2 m^{3}\right) } { \left(0.2081 \displaystyle\frac{kJ}{kg.K}\right) \left(283.15 K\right)} = 4.75192\times 10^{-1} kg
\end{displaymath}

The volume at state 2 can be easily calculated as,
\begin{eqnarray}
&& P_{2}V_{2}=mRT_{2} \nonumber \\
&& V_{2} =\displaystyle\frac{ \left(4.75192\times 10^{-1} kg\right) \left(0.2081 \displaystyle\frac{kJ}{kg.K}\right) \left(453.15 K\right) } {700 kPa} = 6.40155 \times 10^{-2} m^{-3} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

For polytropic processes,
\begin{eqnarray}
&&P_{i}V_{i}^{n} = \text{constant} = C \nonumber \\
&&\displaystyle\frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}} = \left(\displaystyle\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\right)^{n} \nonumber \\
&&\ln \left( \displaystyle\frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}} \right) = \ln \left(\displaystyle\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\right)^{n} \nonumber \\
&& n = \displaystyle\frac{ \ln \left( \displaystyle\frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}} \right)  } { \ln \left(\displaystyle\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\right) }  = 1.41279 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}


So the work in polyprotic processes can be defined as,
\begin{eqnarray}
W_{1}^{2} = && \int\limits_{1}^{2}\displaystyle\frac{C}{V^{n}}dV = C \int\displaystyle\frac{dV}{V^{n}} \nonumber \\
           && \left.\displaystyle\frac{C}{1-n} V^{(1-n)} \right|_{1}^{2} = \displaystyle\frac{C}{1-n}  \left( V_{2}^{(1-n)}-V_{1}^{(1-n)}\right) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
As $C = P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2}$,
\begin{displaymath}
W_{1}^{2} = \displaystyle\frac{P_{2}V_{2}-P_{1}V_{1}}{1-n} = -40.7251 kJ
\end{displaymath}


The work is negative $\Longrightarrow$ {\it Ar} was worked upon in compression. From the first law,
\begin{eqnarray}
&& U_{2} - U_{1} = Q_{1}^{2} - W_{1}^{2} \nonumber \\
&& Q_{1}^{2} = U_{2} - U_{1} + W_{1}^{2} \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Assuming that {\it Ar} behaves like an ideal gas, \ie $u=u(T)$ $\left(\text{with }u=\displaystyle\frac{U}{m}\right)$, 
\begin{displaymath}
\displaystyle\frac{du}{dT} = C_{v}
\end{displaymath}
and hence,
\begin{eqnarray}
Q_{1}^{2} &=& mC_{v}\left(T_{2} - T_{1}\right) + W_{1}^{2} \nonumber \\
         &=& \left( 4.75192\times 10^{-1} kg \right) \left( 0.312 kJ.\left(kg.K\right)^{-1} \right) \nonumber \left( 453.15 K - 283.15 K \right) + \left( -40.7251 kJ \right) \nonumber \\
         &=& \textcolor{red}{-15.5209 kJ} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The variation of heat (or heat transfer) is negative $\Longrightarrow$ heat was lost from the system although temperature increased. This is because the raise in internal energy was mainly due to work than by the heat exchanged.

\item {\it Given air (assuming ideal gas behaviour) expanding reversibly and adiabatically from $T_{1}=450 K$ and $V_{1}=3.0\times 10^{-3}m^{3}$ to the final volume, $V_{2}=5.0\times 10^{-3}m^{3}$. $T$ and $V$ relationship for constant heat capacities is represented by
\begin{displaymath}
\frc{T_{2}}{T_{1}} = \left(\frc{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{\gamma-1}
\end{displaymath}
(a) Derive a relationship between $T$ and $P$; Assuming that $C_{p}= 5.0 cal.\left(mol.K\right)^{-1}$ and $C_{v}=3.0 cal.\left(mol.K\right)^{-1}$, calculate (b) $T_{2}$, (c) the work done during the process and the (d) enthalpy change. }

The total energy change, $\Delta E$ can be split into
\begin{displaymath}
\Delta E = \Delta E_{K} + \Delta E_{P} + \Delta U = Q - W
\end{displaymath}
where $\Delta E_{K}$, $\Delta E_{P}$ and $\Delta U$ represent the change in kinetic, potential and internal energy, respectively. Assuming that the expansion process, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the system does not change,
\begin{displaymath}
\Delta E = \Delta U = Q - W
\end{displaymath}
or in differential form
\begin{displaymath}
dU = \delta Q - \delta W
\end{displaymath}
and all energy exchange with the surroundings are used to only change the internal energy. As the process is adiabatic ($Q=0$),
\begin{displaymath}
 dU = -\delta W = -P dV
\end{displaymath}
Since the gas is ideal, $dU=C_{v}dT = -PdV$ and,
\begin{displaymath}
V=\frc{RT}{P}
\end{displaymath}
and applying the chain rule to $V=V(T,P)$
\begin{displaymath}
dV = \frc{\partial V}{\partial T}dT + \frc{\partial V}{\partial P}dP= -\frc{RT}{P^{2}}dP + \frac{R}{P}dT
\end{displaymath}
 thus replacing $dV$,
\begin{displaymath}
C_{v}dT = - PdV = -P\left[-\frc{RT}{P^{2}}dP + \frc{R}{P}dT\right] = RT\frc{dP}{P} - RdT
\end{displaymath}
Since $C_{p}-C_{v}=R$ and replacing $C_{v}$ in the equation above,
\begin{displaymath}
C_{p}dT = RT\frc{dP}{P} \Longrightarrow \frc{dT}{T} = \frc{R}{C_{p}}\frc{dP}{P} \Longrightarrow \frc{dT}{T} = \frc{C_{p}-C_{v}}{C_{p}}\frc{dP}{P}=\left(\frc{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\right)\frc{dP}{P}
\end{displaymath}
where $\gamma = C_{p}/C_{v}$. Integrating from state 2 to 1:
\begin{eqnarray}
&& \ln\frc{T_{2}}{T_{1}}=\left(\frc{\gamma - 1 }{\gamma}\right)\ln\frc{P_{2}}{P_{1}} \;\;\; \text{or} \nonumber \\
&& \textcolor{red}{\frc{T_{2}}{T_{1}} = \left(\frc{P_{2}}{P_{1}}\right)^{\frc{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}} \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\medskip

Temperature, $T_{2}$ is obtained from 
\begin{eqnarray}
&& \frc{T_{2}}{T_{1}} = \left(\frc{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{\gamma - 1} \nonumber \\
&& T_{2} = T_{1} \left(\frc{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{\gamma - 1 } = (450\;K)\left[\frac{3.0\times 10^{-3}\;\;m^{3}}{5.0\times 10^{-3}\;\;m^{3}}\right]^{\left(\frc{5.0\;cal.\left(mol.K\right)^{-1} }{3.0\; cal.\left(mol.K\right)^{-1}  }-1\right)} \nonumber \\
&& \textcolor{red}{T_{2} = 320.12 K} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The work done during the process is,
\begin{eqnarray}
&& W = -\Delta U = - C_{v}\Delta T = \left[ -3.0\; cal.\left(mol.K\right)^{-1} \right] \left( 320 - 450 \;\;K\right) \nonumber \\
&& \textcolor{red}{W = 390 \frc{cal}{mol} = 1632.85 \frc{J}{mol}} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
$W>0$ indicates that in the expansion process, work is done by the system. The enthalpy change of the gas can be calculated as,
\begin{eqnarray}
&& \Delta H = C_{p}\Delta T = \left[ 5.0\; cal.\left(mol.K\right)^{-1} \right] \left( 320 - 450 \;\;K\right) \nonumber \\
&& \textcolor{red}{\Delta H = -650 \frc{cal}{mol} = -2721.42 \frc{J}{mol}} \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
